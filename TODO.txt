If we are building with IdM, we need to add the IdM root CA cert to the container.
If we are not building with IdM, we need to add any alternate CA certs to the container for secure communication to the target hosts to be managed.
If we cannot, we need to set validate_certs to false.

Extend the Container ENTRYPOINT to accept:
- project         - which rhis-builder repository we want to invoke
- play            - [ main | run_role | run_task | run_role_task ]
- role_name       - required when play is run_role or run_role_task
- task_name       - required when play is run_task or run_role_task
- ssh_pass        - if required, the file containing the ssh credential or the credential
- vault_password  - if required, the file containing the vault password credential or the credential

Enhance the above to use a credential source to get the ssh credential and vault credential.
This may not be necessary as the container launch itself is likely to be wrapped in an ansible play that will get the credentials from a credential source...
layers on layers on layers... half a hundred ways of implementing this.
