# In general the ansible configuration is provided in lists for each of the roles in RHIS.
# The elements should mirror the upstream modules that are used to build the RHIS

# Eventually a full schema will be provided.
# For now, see the example.ca host_vars and group_vars files

# There is a main.yml file in each project. The main.yml file runs all roles and tasks in the proper order to ensure the proper initial build. 
# After the initial build you may run indvidual roles and tasks as necessary for day 2 operations.
# You may also run indvidual roles and tasks to customize your builds.
# Please note that all roles check for the existence of the required configuration list needed.
# If the configuration list is absent or is a zero element length list or dictionary, the role will be skipped

# here is an example


# rhis-builder-satellite 

# Run a simple command to create or update the activation keys for the satellite organization
# See the activation_keys.yml file under satellite.example.ca in the host_vars directory for the required yaml configuration format.
